# üßÆ SuperCalculator
Challenge proposed in module 02 of the XPe minicamp

This advanced calculator was developed as part of the **XPe minicamp**, designed to practice key concepts in **JavaScript** and **user interface design**. The Supercalculadora offers advanced functionality beyond basic arithmetic, such as scientific operations and responsive design.

## üåü Features

- **Basic arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific functions**: Square roots, exponents, trigonometric functions, and more.
- **Responsive design**: Works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Error handling**: Clear user feedback for invalid inputs or operations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gknpp23/SuperCalculator.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd SuperCalculator 
   ```
3. **Open the index.html** file in your browser to start using the SuperCalculator :
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## üìñ Learning Path

The **SuperCalculator ** project was a key component of the **XPe minicamp**, covering:

1. **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Variables, operators, and functions.
2. **Advanced JavaScript**: Handling scientific calculations and implementing memory features.
3. **DOM Manipulation**: Building a dynamic calculator interface with real-time input and output.
4. **Event Handling**: Capturing user input through button clicks and keyboard input.
5. **Error Handling**: Managing user errors and edge cases gracefully.
